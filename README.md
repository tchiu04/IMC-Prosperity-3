## 🧠 IMC Prosperity³ Quantitative Trading Competition

The **IMC Prosperity³** competition is an international quantitative trading challenge hosted by [IMC Trading](https://www.imc.com). Teams of students compete in a simulated market environment where they develop algorithmic trading strategies across a range of financial instruments.

### 📌 Competition Highlights
- **Market Simulation:** Participants interact with a live market featuring real-time order books, limit orders, and price volatility.
- **Product Diversity:** The market includes a variety of assets such as baskets, vouchers, and components, each with unique behaviors and constraints.
- **Strategic Focus:** Success relies on applying concepts from statistics, game theory, and market microstructure, while responding to dynamic market conditions.
- **Rounds-Based:** The competition progresses in rounds (trading days), with increasing complexity and new products introduced over time.
- **Performance Metric:** Teams are ranked based on their final Profit & Loss (PnL) while managing risk and respecting position limits.

### 🛠️ My Role
I participated as a quant developer and strategist, where I:
- Engineered market-making and mean-reversion strategies using Python.
- Designed signal features from historical price spreads, VWAPs, and basket-component relationships.
- Built automated trading agents with adaptive logic to adjust to real-time market shifts.
- Performed backtesting and parameter tuning on thousands of timestamps.
